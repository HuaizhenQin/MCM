# The the MCM is a freely available R package for implementing numerical computations and graphical illustrations of multi-omics design and data mining. It consists of R functions for multi-level power analyses and sample size evaluations under simple random sampling (SRS) and extreme phenotype sampling (EPS) designs. The functions MCVM.Power(.) compute powers whereas the function MCVM.n(.) determines sample sizes to reach a certain powers of level-specific tests under each sampling design. Both of the functions call corresponding functions for computing the non-centrality parameters. All the functions adopts fast and stable numerical algorithms without using any resampling techniques.
